See [Comparison with other national and international IGs](comparison.html) for a comparison between AU Core profiles and profiles in other implementation guides.

### Profile specific implementation guidance
- Even though AU Patient Summary Profiles allow both PractitionerRole and Practitioner to be referenced, because PractitionerRole supplies a providerâ€™s location, contact information, and reference to the Practitioner, it **SHOULD** be referenced instead of the Practitioner resource. 
- See guidance on the construction of an identifier on the relevant Identifier profile page and the section on [Business Identifiers](https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-base/generalguidance.html#business-identifiers) in AU Base.
