#### AU Patient Summary 0.4.0-draft for Testing 

This August 2025 draft snapshot incorporates updates from IPS 2.0.0 ballot reconciliation. This snapshot supports the HL7 Australia September 2025 Connectathon.

Connectathon testing plays a crucial role in the development of AU Patient Summary. It helps to build an AU Patient Summary that is aligned with its intended purpose and is practical, and responsive to the diverse needs of various stakeholders.  

Testing AU Patient Summary helps identify issues, challenges, or gaps in the specification, enabling its improvement. During testing, implementers test their FHIR resources, software products, and/or proof of concepts with AU Patient Summary and provide essential feedback.
