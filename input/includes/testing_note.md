#### AU Patient Summary 0.2.0-preview for testing 

This June 2025 preview snapshot supports testing of AU Patient Summary prior to Ballot of AU Patient Summary R1.

Testing plays a crucial role in the development of AU Patient Summary. It helps to build an AU Patient Summary that is aligned with its intended purpose and is practical, and responsive to the diverse needs of various stakeholders.  

Testing AU Patient Summary helps identify issues, challenges, or gaps in the specification, enabling its improvement. During testing, implementers test their FHIR resources, software products, and/or proof of concepts with AU Patient Summary and provide essential feedback.
