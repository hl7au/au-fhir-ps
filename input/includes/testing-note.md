#### AU Patient Summary 0.5.0-preview for Testing

This December 2025 preview snapshot incorporates the normative changes from AU c ballot reconciliation. This snapshot supports the HL7 Australia December 2025 Connectathon.

Key updates and changes in this version are shown in the AU Patient Summary [Change Log](changes.html).

Connectathon testing plays a crucial role in the development of AU Patient Summary. It helps to build an AU Patient Summary that is aligned with its intended purpose and is practical, and responsive to the diverse needs of various stakeholders.

Testing AU Patient Summary helps identify issues, challenges, or gaps in the specification, enabling its improvement. During testing, implementers test their FHIR resources, software products, and/or proof of concepts with AU Patient Summary and provide essential feedback.
