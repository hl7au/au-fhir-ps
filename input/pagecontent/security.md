### Security and Privacy

Implementers are advised to be familiar with the requirements of the IPS and AU Core when implementing AU PS, in particular:
- [IPS Privacy and Security Considerations](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-ips/Privacy-and-Security-Considerations.html)
- [AU Core Security and Privacy](https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-core/security.html)
- [FHIR security considerations](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/security.html)

Those implementing AU PS are also advised to review the [FHIR Implementer Safety Checklist](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/safety.html) for important considerations in secure and safe system implementation.
