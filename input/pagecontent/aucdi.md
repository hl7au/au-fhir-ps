[Australian Core Data for Interoperability (AUCDI)](https://sparked.csiro.au/index.php/sparked-products-resources/australian-core-data-for-interoperability/aucdi-release-1/) is the product of a national clinician focussed requirements gathering project operating as part of the [Sparked AU FHIR Accelerator](https://sparked.csiro.au/).  The AUCDI outputs form a set of data requirements to be considered and referred to as part of the development and definition of AU Patient Summary.
