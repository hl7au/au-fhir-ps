AU Patient Summary complies with, and leverages, national and international standards, in particular:
- [International Patient Access 1.0.0](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ipa/STU1/)
- [International Patient Summary Implementation Guide 2.0.0-ballot](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/2024Sep/)
- [AU Core Implementation Guide](https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-core/)

Relationships between AU Patient Summary, AU Core, AUCDI, and the above key implementation guides is described in [Relationship with other IGs](relationship.html). 

Corresponding profiles, conformance requirements, and capability statements included in the key FHIR implementation guides were reviewed and considered during AU Core's development to ensure alignment, and to facilitate adoption of, this standard.

The below comparison evaluates AU Patient Summary conformance requirements with the key implementation guides identifying where compliance with AU Patient Summary satisfies the expectations established by the referenced implementation guide. 

At this time only TBD is available. 

### Profile comparison
As part of profile comparison, the requirements, constraints, and standards specified in a particular FHIR profile are evaluated. These requirements can include mandatory elements, must support elements, cardinality constraints, data types, terminology bindings, usage rules, extensions, rules on missing or suppressed data. 

The table below provides a profile only comparison from AU Patient Summary to profiles in key implementation guides. Compliance in the reverse direction is not guaranteed, i.e. a resource that is compliant with an International Patient Summary profile **MAY NOT** be compliant with AU Patient Summary.

**Legend:**

<img src="green_checkmark.svg.png" width="20"/> **Compliant**: An AU Core compliant resource meets all requirements of the compared profile.

<img src="orange_checkmark.svg.png" width="20"/> **Additional requirements**: An AU Core compliant resource is compatible, but additional changes may be needed to meet all requirements of the compared profile. Where additional requirements are identified, more information is provided in the sections below.

<img src="cross_red_circle.svg.png" width="20"/> **Incompatible**: An AU Core compliant resource is incompatible with the compared profile. A resource cannot be compliant to both. Where incompatible requirements are identified, more information is provided in the sections below.
