This use case describes an example scenario where, during a general practitioner (GP) consultation with a new patient who resides in a different state and has a usual GP, the GP retrieves an up-to-date patient summary from the patient's usual GP. 

### Use Case Description

Jeramy Ezra Banks, a 73-year-old man from New South Wales, has been managing chronic heart disease since his diagnosis five years ago. His regular general practitioner (GP), Dr Abe Lowe, oversees his ongoing care. Comfortable with basic technology, Jeramy uses a smartphone app to access and manage his health records.

Before travelling to Queensland for a holiday to visit his daughter, Jeramy confirms via the app that his patient summary has been updated by Dr Lowe following a recent hospital admission.

While on the road, Jeramy begins to feel unwell - he is gasping for breath and feels stiff after driving. He books an appointment with a local GP in Queensland, Dr Wyatt Samuels.

During the consultation, Jeramy informs Dr Samuels that his health information is available via a patient summary shared by his regular GP. Jeramy provides access using a Smart Health Link presented via his smartphone app. Dr Samuels retrieves the most recent patient summary directly from Dr Lowe’s clinical information system (CIS). The patient summary has been curated by Dr Lowe and attested at time of update, ensuring its integrity and alignment with clinical standards. 

The summary enables Dr Samuels to quickly understand Jeramy’s condition, recent treatment, and current medications - supporting safe and informed clinical decision-making during the consultation.
