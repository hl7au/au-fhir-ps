The following actor definitions define theÂ actor roles that a system can implement for AU Patient Summary.

- [AU PS Consumer actor](ActorDefinition-au-ps-actor-consumer.html)

An AU PS Consumer is a system that receives an AU PS Bundle and uses it to display or process patient summary content. This actor is based on the [Consumer (IPS)](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-ips/ActorDefinition-Consumer.html) actor, and describes the additional requirements and documentation applied for the Australian context.

- [AU PS Producer actor](ActorDefinition-au-ps-actor-producer.html)

An AU PS Producer is a system that creates or assembles an AU PS Bundle through automated generation or human curation of the patient summary content. This actor is based on the [Creator (IPS)](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-ips/ActorDefinition-Creator.html) actor, and describes the additional requirements and documentation applied for the Australian context.
