# === ERROR 03: Bundle.entry slicing discriminator mismatch. IPS slices Bundle.entry using both type:resource and profile:resource discriminators. AU PS uses only type:resource to enforce stricter control over allowed entry types. This causes a mismatch with IPS, but is intentional to ensure AU PS-specific profiles are used. ===

# === ERROR 04: This error is raised because AU PS Pathology Result Observation is modelled with structural differences to Observation Results - Laboratory/Pathology (IPS) that the tooling is not able to reconcile as compliant: a) IPS invariants and AU Core invariants set the same rules but use different FHIRPath b) Observation.category slicing discriminator is different; IPS uses pattern:$this and AU PS uses code/system. b) Observation.value[x], IPS labels data types string, Quantity and CodeableConcept as Must Support. AU PS is stronger by placing the rule on the element i.e. every data type has obligations on it not just the three IPS. ===

# === WARNING 03: AU PS Bundle profile is sliced by resource type. For profiles of type Observation, the slice includes all relevant profiles and to remain open (allowing for additional profiles of Observation) includes the Observation resource.

The IG Publisher cannot match example instances to a single profile and generates these warnings. This behaviour is expected and consistent with the design of AU PS (and IPS). ===

# === INFORMATION 06: AU PS includes only complete examples i.e. Bundle examples. While each profile does have at least one Bundle instance with an example of this profile this information message is present in an IG if a standalone resource instance example is not present, it does not look inside Bundles or other resource types (e.g. if a resource instance is contained). ===
The Implementation Guide contains no explicitly linked examples for this profile

# === INFORMATION 07: AU PS Bundle profile is sliced by resource type. For profiles of type Observation, the slice includes all relevant profiles and to remain open (allowing for additional profiles of Observation) includes the Observation resource. This means that Artefacts inherit multiple profiles for certain data types (e.g., Address, Identifier). The IG Publisher cannot match example instances to a single profile and generates these warnings. This behaviour is expected and consistent with the design of AU PS (and IPS). ===
The entry resource matched more than one of the allowed profiles (http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Observation, http://hl7.org.au/fhir/ps/StructureDefinition/au-ps-diagnosticresult-path)
The entry resource matched more than one of the allowed profiles (http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Observation, http://hl7.org.au/fhir/ps/StructureDefinition/au-ps-smokingstatus)

# === INFORMATION 08: The use of the obligation extension generates multiple slicing information messages in the snapshot. This extension is reused across many resources in leading to repeated validation messages that do not appear to indicate an actual problem. Other IGs that are using obligations (e.g. IPS, IPA, EPS) show the same set of QA "element does not match any known slice" slicing information messages that have been accepted for publication (see https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/channel/179252-IG-creation/topic/Obligations.20extension.20does.20not.20meet.20slice/with/553529895). ===
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/obligation|5.2.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)

# === INFORMATION 09: The Bundle example that is digitally signed uses a feature in IG publisher to generate that signature when building the IG. These information messages provide the metadata around that signature generation ===

# === INFORMATION 14: AU PS Bundle allows multiple Observation profiles. IG Publisher evaluates each Observation entry against all allowed Observation profiles and reports information messages for profiles that do not match. This is expected behaviour when an Observation is intended to conform to one specific profile. Messages involving Patient-uv-ips resolution failures are a consequence of the IPS dependency limitation described in ERROR 01 and do not indicate any issues with the AU PS specification. ===
