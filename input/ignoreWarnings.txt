# ==== ERROR 01: This error is caused by an IPS 2.0.0 internal dependency on hl7.fhir.uv.extensions.r4#5.3.0-ballot-tc1 that downstream IGs don’t load. Not an AU PS defect. IPS will publish a 2.0.1 errata/technical correction to resolve this for downstream IGs. See Zulip: https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/channel/207835-IPS/topic/IPS.202.2E0.2E1.20errata.2Ftechnical.20correction/with/547940503====
ERROR: StructureDefinition/au-ps-patient: StructureDefinition: This profile does not comply with claimed profile 'http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/StructureDefinition/Patient-uv-ips'

# === ERROR 02: This issue will be fixed in a later version of the IG Publisher (see: https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/channel/179252-IG-creation/topic/Publisher.20v2.2E0.2E24.20-.20error.20in.20local.20build). ===

# === ERROR 03: Bundle.entry slicing discriminator mismatch. IPS slices Bundle.entry using both type:resource and profile:resource discriminators. AU PS uses only type:resource to enforce stricter control over allowed entry types. This causes a mismatch with IPS, but is intentional to ensure AU PS-specific profiles are used. ===
StructureDefinition/au-ps-bundle: StructureDefinition: This profile does not comply with claimed profile 'http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/StructureDefinition/Bundle-uv-ips'

# === === ERROR 04: AU PS profile asserts compliance with IPS but there are some structural differences that cause the tooling validation error: a) IPS invariants and AU Core invariants set the same rules but use different FHIRPathsthe tooling is unable to match them ad reports the rules as missing. b) Observation.category slicing discriminator mismatch. IPS slices using pattern:$this while AU PS inherits slices by code/system from AU Core. b) For Observation.value[x], IPS labels data types string, Quantity and CodeableConcept as MS. AU PS is stronger by placing the rule on the element i.e. every data type has obligations on it not just the three IPS. These differences trigger validation errors but the profiles are functionally compatible.  ===

# === ERROR 05: Target profile in MedicationStatement.reasonReference is flagged due to IPS profile not being derived from AU Core base profile. This is a known cross-profile compatibility limitation when constraining to both AU Core and IPS derived targets. ===
MedicationStatement.reasonReference: Error at http://hl7.org.au/fhir/ps/StructureDefinition/au-ps-medicationstatement#MedicationStatement.reasonReference: The target profile http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/StructureDefinition/DiagnosticReport-uv-ips is not a valid constraint on the base ([CanonicalType[http://hl7.org.au/fhir/core/StructureDefinition/au-core-condition], CanonicalType[http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Observation], CanonicalType[http://hl7.org.au/fhir/StructureDefinition/au-diagnosticreport]])

# ==== ERROR 06: This warning occurs because AU PS Smoking Status inherits SNOMED patternCodeableConcept from AU Core where IPS requires a LOINC pattern on Observation.code. AU PS profiles support both SNOMED and LOINC codings to satisfy both AU Core and IPS requirements.====

# === WARNING 02: INHERITED FROM AU BASE: Artefacts inherit multiple profiles for certain data types (e.g., Address, Identifier). The IG Publisher cannot match example instances to a single profile and generates these warnings. This behaviour is expected and consistent with the design of AU Base. ===

# === INFORMATION 02: INHERITED FROM FHIR STANDARD: Some FHIR standard ValueSets are deprecated. ===
Reference to deprecated ValueSet http://hl7.org/fhir/5.0/ValueSet/jurisdiction|5.0.0

# === INFORMATION 03: These issues are known FHIR standard and Extension Pack future version and current deprecations. ===
The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing) 
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-maxValueSet|5.2.0 is deprecated
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/regex|5.2.0 is deprecated with the note: 'This was deprecated in favor of using a constraint on the element using FHIRPath, since constraints allow for the provision of a human readable message associated with the regex'

# === INFORMATION 08: The use of the obligation extension generates multiple slicing information messages in the snapshot. This extension is reused across many resources in leading to repeated validation messages that do not appear to indicate an actual problem. Other IGs that are using obligations (e.g. IPS, IPA, EPS) show the same set of QA "element does not match any known slice" slicing information messages that have been accepted for publication (see https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/channel/179252-IG-creation/topic/Obligations.20extension.20does.20not.20meet.20slice/with/553529895). ===
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/obligation|5.2.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)
