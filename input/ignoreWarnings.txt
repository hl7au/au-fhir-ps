# ERROR: Bundle.entry slicing discriminator mismatch. IPS slices Bundle.entry using both type:resource and profile:resource discriminators. AU PS uses only type:resource to enforce stricter control over allowed entry types. This causes a mismatch with IPS, but is intentional to ensure AU PS-specific profiles are used. ===
ERROR: StructureDefinition/au-ps-bundle: StructureDefinition: This profile does not comply with claimed profile 'http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/StructureDefinition/Bundle-uv-ips'

# ERROR: AU PS profile asserts compliance with IPS but there are some structural differences that cause the tooling validation error: a) Observation.category slicing discriminator mismatch. IPS slices using pattern:$this while AU PS inherits slices by code/system from AU Core. b) For Observation.value[x], IPS labels data types string, Quantity and CodeableConcept as MS. AU PS is stronger by placing the rule on the element i.e. every data type has obligations on it not just the three IPS. These differences trigger validation errors but the profiles are functionally compatible.  ===

# ERROR: doNotPerform mismatch in AU PS MedicationRequest. IPS now sets doNotPerform = false (pre-applied block vote 12 tracker FHIR-51483), but AU PS hasnâ€™t applied this change yet. This is a known difference and will be resolved in a future update.===

# === WARNING: The following warnings flag aspects of FHIR implementation of best practice. These warnings do not indicate an error in the specification, and ignore profiled requirements. These warnings were accepted in AU Core v1.0.0.==
Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer

# === WARNING: Artefacts inherit multiple profiles for certain data types (e.g., Address, Identifier) from AU Base. The IG Publisher cannot match example instances to a single profile and generates these warnings. This behaviour is expected and consistent with the design of AU Core and AU Base.

# === # Warning about IPS profile compliance. This occurs because the IPS profile is imposed via structuredefinition-compliesWithProfile, which is not fully understood or enforced by the validator. The warning is expected and safe to ignore, manual validation confirms the profile is aligned with the imposed IPS profile. ===
WARNING: StructureDefinition/au-ps-condition: StructureDefinition: The validator cannot confirm that this profile complies with the claimed profile 'http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ips/StructureDefinition/Condition-uv-ips'

This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org.au/fhir/ps/StructureDefinition/au-ps-diagnosticresult-path|0.3.0-ballot (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice) 

# === INFORMATION: Information about the AU Core use of the discriminator type 'pattern,' which is fully valid and supported in FHIR R4 but deprecated in R5+. This does not affect the functionality or conformance in R4. Future updates will consider transitioning to the recommended 'type=value' approach to ensure compatibility with R5+. ===
The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)

# === INFORMATION: This is HL7 Terminology managed content. IG Publisher generated a message when it detects artefacts with a status of 'draft' or 'deprecated'. This is known, accepted behaviour for IG Publisher. ===
Reference to deprecated ValueSet http://hl7.org/fhir/5.0/ValueSet/jurisdiction|5.0.0 

# === INFORMATION: These informational messages are triggered due to the tooling setup in the IG Publisher, which infers the default language (en-AU) from the jurisdiction. The terminology server (tx.ontoserver) used for validation does not support en-AU for SNOMED CT lookups and instead expects en. This is a known limitation of the tooling and terminology server setup.

The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-maxValueSet|5.3.0-ballot-tc1 is deprecated with the note Use additionalBinding extension or element instead
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/regex|5.3.0-ballot-tc1 is deprecated with the note This was deprecated in favor of using a constraint on the element using FHIRPath, since constraints allow for the provision of a human readable message associated with the regex
